# Snake Game Project

In this project, I created the classic Snake Game using Python. This project is a part of the Python 100 course by Angela Hu.

## Project Overview

The Snake Game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The goal is to eat food that appears on the screen, which causes the snake's length to increase. However, the game becomes more challenging as the snake grows longer and must avoid colliding with its own body or the walls of the screen.
