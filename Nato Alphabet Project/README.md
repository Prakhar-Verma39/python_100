Creating a README.md file for a Python100 course project, such as the "NATO Alphabet project," is a great way to provide project details and resources for students. Here's a template you can use:

```markdown
# NATO Alphabet Project

Welcome to the NATO Alphabet Project, a part of the Python100 course! This project is designed to help you learn and practice Python by implementing a simple program that converts text to the NATO phonetic alphabet.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create a Python program that takes user input (text) and converts it into the corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. The NATO phonetic alphabet is used in aviation, military, and other contexts to ensure clear communication of letters and numbers.

## Features

- Convert text to NATO phonetic alphabet representation.
- Display the converted text.

## Video Tutorial

To assist you with this project, we've provided a video tutorial:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nato-alphabet-project.git
   cd nato-alphabet-project
   ```

2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable).

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python nato_alphabet.py
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the script to convert text to the NATO phonetic alphabet.

## Code Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `nato_alphabet.py`: The Python script for the NATO Alphabet conversion.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
